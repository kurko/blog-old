  <p>
    I work as software engineer at
    Ride, startup based in NY. I study very hard
    the areas of software engineering and project management,
    with great interest in human psycology.

    These are some of the keywords that could represent my professional skills.

    I've put a lot of effort in the study of original concepts from Alan Kay on
    Object-Oriented Programming. Differently from what people tend to conclude,
    OOP and Functional Programming are not opposite. In fact, they're paradigms
    of totally different levels that can be applied in the same software
    architecture.

    These are some of the things I share here.
