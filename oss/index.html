      <p>
        Here are some projects I created.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-project">
        Vito <a href="https://github.com/kurko/vito" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        A promising provisioning gem to replace Chef and Puppet.
        You define a Gemfile-like
        file with what you want to be installed in the server. The rest is taken
        care of by Vito. A must see project.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-project">
        Crane <a href="https://github.com/kurko/crane" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        This gem will analyze what are the latest modified files and upload them
        to a FTP server. Say you want to upload only file modified within 2 hours?
        This gem does that.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-project">
        Omniscient <a href="https://github.com/kurko/omniscient" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Simple gem for importing remote databases via SSH.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-project">
        Flying <a href="https://github.com/kurko/flying" target="github" class="project-tit" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although the gem is out-dated, the premise is very good. Basically,
        you define a Gemfile-like file with the external dependencies your app has,
        such as Fedex, AdWords or others. Whenever one of those websites is down,
        you're notified.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-project">
        Richer <a href="https://github.com/kurko/richer" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Super light-weight Javascript lib to have a simple WYSIWYG textarea editor.
        Has basic features, such as bold and italic.
      </p>

      <h1 class="category-sub">RESEARCH, UNDOCUMENTED GEMS</h1>
      <h2 class="title-project">
        Kanji <a href="https://github.com/kurko/kanji" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a gem for recognizing japanese Kanjis in images with artificial
        neural nets. Pretty neat. You can see it working in the test files. I
        basically teach the neural nets the meaning of each kanji and then it
        becomes capable of recognizing it later.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-project">
        Emerald.js <a href="https://github.com/kurko/emerald.js" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Yet another Javascript MVC framework. Although I'll not use it because
        we have Ember.js, you can check the source code to see how to build
        controllers, ORM, auto-update of view elements, and others.
      </p>

    <div class="content-4">
      <h1 class="category-sub">Vim plugins</h1>
      <h2>
        smartest.vim <a href="https://github.com/kurko/smartest.vim" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        With this plugin, whenever you run `RunTestFile()` smartest.vim will
        check if you're in a Ruby or JS project, if you're using spring, zeus or
        other gem to make your specs fast, and run specs on the fastest mechanism
        possible. I can't live without this plugin anymore.
      </p>

      <h2>
        autocoder.vim <a href="https://github.com/kurko/autocoder.js" target="github" class="project-tit">(github)</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the biggest barrier when coding is the IDE you use. This plugin
        will generate Ruby classes and specs for you. No more excuses like
        "creating yet another class is painful".
